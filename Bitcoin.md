## Summary

The largest and first cryptocurrency.  

Bitcoin is simply a trusted public ledger ([what is a public ledger](about/PublicLedger.md)).  
    
Miners secure the ledger from malicious activity such as double spending (i.e. I use my BTC to buy something from both Bob and Joe, but only one of them can actually get paid.)  They do this with a [Proof of Work algorithm](about/ProofOfWork.md).
