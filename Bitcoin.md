# Bitcoin

## Summary

The largest and first cryptocurrency.  

Bitcoin is simply a trusted public ledger ([what is a public ledger](about/PublicLedger.md)).  
    
Miners secure the ledger from malicious activity such as double spending (e.g. I use my BTC to buy something from both Bob and Joe, but only one of them can actually get paid.)  They do this with a [Proof of Work algorithm](about/ProofOfWork.md).

### Tech

 - [Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper)
 - POW algorithm: SHA-256 
 - Block size: 1MB, [Segwit](about/Segwit.md) is optional
 - Difficulty: target 10 mins per block, recalcs every 2016 blocks
 - Minting: 12.5 per block to the miner (which cuts in half every 210,000 blocks and reaches 0 in 2140)
 - Transaction fees: rate defined by supply and demand and goes to the miner.

### Market

 - Filled with Crazy Buzz! 
    - "It's the Money of the Future"
    - Government currencies are going to collapse
    - Freedom!
 - Highly volatile
    - +/- 20% in a day is faily common
 - Futures ([what are futures?](about/Futures.md))
    - Launched Dec 2017, Bitcoin is the first and only with futures (others are already in the works) 

### Pros

 - Name Brand
 - Secure
   - Transactions are not reversable
 - Decentralized 
 - Worldwide

### Cons

 - Ridiculous amounts energy consumed
   - Estimated to be about 215 kilowatt-hours (KWh) per transaction, with the network currently totaling as much energy as Denmark consumes.

 - Very long term it's on course to crash to 0 (around 2140, unless a hard fork is used to address this concern). 
   - Why: Competition amoung miners is what keeps the network secure.  Miners are compensated for this work by minting new coins with each block.  The number of coins minted decreases periodically and in 2022
