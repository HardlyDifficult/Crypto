General Recommendations

 - Buy coins at [Coinbase](coinbase.com/join/59ebf3c17be14a00f92091b8) and we both get $10.  
   - Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges and is based in California.  
   - You can buy there and then transfer to an offline wallet or another exchange (which allows you to trade alt coins).
   - Not all countries are supported though...
   - Other [recommended exchanges](recs/Exchanges.md)
 - Do not use Paypal ([source](https://themerkle.com/paypal-continues-crackdown-on-crypto-sellers-permanently-limits-accounts/)).
 - There are thousands of coins and ICOs.  Many are completely worthless, some are outright scams, and most will crash to 0.  Be skeptical.
