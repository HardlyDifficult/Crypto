# CryptoCurrency

The comments on this page apply to every cryptocurrency, with very few exceptions (which will be called out when discussing those specific coins).

## Market

 - Government currencies are going to collapse.  

## Use Cases 

 - Stored value
   - "Digital Gold" - Bitcoin has value because people think it's going to grow in value.
 - Transaction medium
   - An alternative to credit cards, Paypal, bank wires, etc.
 - Bypass government
   - Country-to-country and transactions for any good or service cannot be directly stopped by any entity.

## Pros

 - Predictable/predetermined minting rate
   - Other currencies, such as the USD, have no restrictions on the amount created each year (and often do not even need to disclose the amount added).  This could lead to inflation.

## Other points

 - Enables illegal trading
   - But, one could argue it does not enable this any more than cash does.
