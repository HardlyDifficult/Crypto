# Nodes

A decentralized network, by definition, has no central servers.  The data for the blockchain, including its entire history since the very first transaction, is hosted by a peer-to-peer network of "nodes".

## What is a Node?

A node is a computer which downloads every block and pending transactions to be processed by miners.  

 - Information is synchronized by nodes sharing updates with other nodes.  
 - Anyone can create a transaction and send it to a node to be redistributed and eventually processed into a block by a miner.
 - Miners create a block and then send it to a node.  
   - As long as the block is part of the chain with the most work put into it, it will continue to be shared with other nodes.
   - Blocks which are submitted but do not remain part of the chain are typically discarded (but some coins handle this differently.)

## Who Can Operate a Node?

Anyone.  For most coins, just double click the app and then you're a node.
