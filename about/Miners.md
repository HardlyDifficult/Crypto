# Miner

A miner is an entity which selects a set of transactions to process, confirms their validity, and then uses an algorithm such as Proof of Work to assert that the block (and the transactions it contains) should be accepted by the network.

## Who Can Be a Miner?

Anyone.  There is a huge variety between coins on the barrier to entry (e.g., the type of hardware required to stand a chance).

## Why Are They Called "Miners"?

It's an analogy to gold.  For most coins, the mining process mints new coins as well.  The analogy loosely goes as follows:

    Miners looking for gold work hard, and many turn up nothing.  Occasionally a miner gets lucky, finds gold, and enjoys a nice payday, enough to fund more mining with hopes of getting lucky again.
