# Transactions Per Second (TPS)

This is the max throughput of the system.  Typically it's limited by a combination of the block size and the difficulty (or how quickly blocks are generated).

 - Difficulty typically adjusts for a target cadence, which means it does not accommodate a spike in transaction volume.
 - Changing block size requires a fork.

For comparison: Visa in 2010 could scale to 25k TPS (Bitcoin in 2017 is 4 TPS).
