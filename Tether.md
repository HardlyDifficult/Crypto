## Pros

- The goal of Tether is to allow for stored value without risking price volatility.
   - Enables traders to more easily move in and out of the CryptoCurrency market, allowing them to maximize gains from the volatility.
 - Tether claims to be backed 1:1 with actual USD.  

## Cons

 - Supply is dictated by the Tether company.
 - 

## Is Tether a Scam?

Seems like it. I expect there will be a sudden crash to 0.

## Failures

 - $50 million stolen.
   - A hacker stole $50 million in Tether from one of Tether's own wallets.
   - The next day, Tether issued a new $50 million worth of tokens.
