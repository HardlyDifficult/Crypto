### In General 

See [about CryptoCurrency](about/CryptoCurrency.md) and [about Proof of Work](about/ProofOfWork.md).  

The comments below are specific to Bitcoin Cash and exclude general pros/cons of crypto.

## Market

 - Expected to be the 4th Crypto added to Coinbase.
 - Drama RE 'BCash' and a possible flippening.
    - Although technically simple to raise this limit, the community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate.

## Pros

 - Faster and cheaper than Bitcoin with more throughput.
 - [Researching throughput](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BUIP/blob/master/065.mediawiki)
   - Aiming for 3,500 TPS and 1GB blocks in 5 years.
   - I'm unclear how active this research really is.

## Cons

 - Could lead to a flippening
   - If Bitcoin Cash continues to grow and overtake Bitcoin in terms of Marketcap, it may take over the name as well.  Bitcoin as we know it today would be renamed to 'Bitcoin Classic'.
   - This risk creates confusion in the market for both coins.
 - Changes made by Bitcoin Cash are incremental so far, they do not address long term concerns.
   - But are researching more
 - Centralization 
    - Larger blocks increase the cost of operating nodes.  If node adoption drops, smaller miners will be disadvantaged from the propegation delays.
