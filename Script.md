# Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin

Motivation For Bitcoin Cash:
 
 - Concern: 
    - Throughput (about 4 TPS today vs Visa's 50k TPS)
    - Transaction fees (averaging ~$5 at the time and rising, today $30+ for BTC transactions)
    - Net net means Bitcoin does not have a future as a transaction medium. (BCH has support for ~32 TPS and ~$0.20 transactions ATM)
 - Normal Process Failed To Simple 'Upgrade' Bitcoin: 
    - No governance model.
        - Create a fork and encourage (on Twitter, etc) miners and nodes to use that instead of the original.
        - If the fork gets enough attention, the original will eventually be dropped completely.
    - "Community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate"
 - Lead to: Hardfork of Bitcoin
    - "Technically simple to raise this limit"
      - Low risk, not fundementally changing anything from the prooven Bitcoin model
    - What is a fork? 
        - Like a Github fork, copy/paste of the original and then you can make tweaks or add features without changing the original.
        - Includes the existing ledger. 1 BTC before the fork becomes 1 BTC plus 1 BCH
 - Change 1: Blocksize Increased (8x)
   - What is a block ? Collection of transactions which have been validated and added to the chain/history  (produced on a regular cadence)
    - Pros
      - More transactions per second
    - Cons
        - Why limit the size at all?
            - Originally Bitcoin had no limit (set in 2010)
            - Huge blocks could be added to make the cost to operate a node or miner higher.  Leads to centralization (requires a larger and larger investment)
       - Any compromise can lead to centralization due to the increased operating costs
 - Change 2: Segwit Removed
   - What's segwit? Segregated Witness is a way of increasing the blocksize
   - Pros
      - It's a way of increasing blocksize with a soft fork (a workaround for the lack of prompt consensus)
   - Cons
      - Actually costs slightly more then if they simply increased the blocksize.
