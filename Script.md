NOTES FORM PINK for you to delete after reading: Assuming this is a script from which someone will eventually read aloud, you'll want to spell out large (i.e., 'fifty thousand' instead of writing '50,000'), currencies ('thirty dollars' instead of '$30') as people are more easily able to read/speak simultaneously in this format. Same with abbreviations ('megabyte' vs 'MB'). Also, certain punctuation choices can influence how something is read aloud - a hyphen, for instance, can create a more natural pause when reading (as opposed to parentheses). <- see what I did there? Kappa. James, pay the man.

I'm not sure what 'net net' is on lines 19/49, so I left it in. :)

# Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin

## Intro

You may have heard of Bitcoin Cash, but how is it different from Bitcoin?

Let's start by looking at the problems with Bitcoin that Bitcoin Cash wanted to address.

Bitcoin's currently running at max capacity. It simply cannot process any more transactions than it already is.  

Bitcoin supports about 4 transactions per second.  Compare this to Visa's network, which can handle over fifty thousand transactions per second. 

Transaction fees on Bitcoin are also rising due to this limit.  When Bitcoin Cash was created in July 2017, Bitcoin's fees were around $5 and rising.  As of Dec 2017, we see fees of thirty dollars or more, while Bitcoin Cash's fees are only 20 cents.

Net net the concern is that if this limit is not addressed, there is no future for Bitcoin as a transaction medium.  It simply cannot compete with Visa or Paypal.

## How Bitcoin Upgrades?

Bitcoin can be changed, and has changed in the past.  Changes are made when the majority of the community accepts those changes. 

However, changes are slow coming as there are no official leaders and no formal process for reaching consensus.  Anyone can make a proposal for the community to consider; in theory, the strongest proposals gain enough support, and then may successfully be rolled out. 

There is a group known as Bitcoin Core.  This group has earned the reputation of being leaders for Bitcoin without actually having any power.  They are not the owners of Bitcoin and cannot force a change to be accepted.

For a change to be accepted, consumers, node operators, and miners all need to agree to the change.

There are a lot of different ways that problems like transaction throughput could be addressed. Bitcoin has been debating this topic for years, and is making very little progress in terms of actually growing the network.

In fact, Bitcoin Cash's approach to addressing this problem, which we will review in a moment, was a proposal reviewed by Bitcoin Core as early as 2015.

## What Bitcoin Cash Did 

Bitcoin Cash created a hard fork in July of 2017, which included two small changes to Bitcoin's technology, anticipated to significantly increase how many transactions the network can handle.

A 'Hard-Fork' means that Bitcoin was copy-pasted, and then modified for Bitcoin Cash.  

This copy-paste means that Bitcoin Cash inherits Bitcoin's security and stability, allowing them to make a small, targeted, low-risk change.

The copy-paste also means anyone with Bitcoin before the fork has both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash after the fork.

Wait, did I just double my money?!  In a way, yes.  If I had 1 Bitcoin before the fork, after the fork I have 1 Bitcoin plus 1 Bitcoin Cash. Once the fork has happened, they are independent, so I can spend my Bitcoin Cash without losing any Bitcoin.

Normally when there is a hard-fork, one of the two forks is the clear winner and the other becomes worthless, and is eventually discarded.  This means that net net, when a fork happens the total money in the end is the same as where it started.

However, Bitcoin Cash has stood strong, as has Bitcoin.  Neither has proved themselves to be the clear winner, so both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have real value.

Don't you wish you had bought Bitcoin before the fork?
...I do.

## Technically, What Changed?

Bitcoin Cash technically only made two small changes from Bitcoin.

The first is, they increased the maximum size of a block.

A block is a set of transactions which have been verified by miners and added to the blockchain.  

Most blockchains, Bitcoin included, have a target cadence for producing blocks.  This means that if more miners start creating blocks, the work gets harder so that the same number of blocks are actually produced.

Increasing the maximum size of this block allows the network to process more transactions.  Another viable approach for supporting more transactions could be to decrease the target time between blocks - this is the approach Litecoin took.

Bitcoin Cash increased the blocksize from 1 megabyte to 8 megabytes.  This means Bitcoin Cash can handle 8 times as many transactions as Bitcoin.  

Due to the increased throughput, Bitcoin Cash also offers significantly lower fees - at least until they reach capacity, too.

So why wouldn't Bitcoin want to increase the limit?  And wait - why is there a limit at all?

Originally Bitcoin had no limit.  The limit of 1 megabyte per block was added in 2010.  This limit was introduced to prevent a possible attack on Bitcoin.

Huge blocks could be added to increase the operating a node or miner.  As a larger and larger hardware investment is required, less hobbyists participate and the network starts to be controlled by a limited number of large companies.  

The second change Bitcoin Cash made was to remove support for Segwit.  Segwit, or segregated witness, is a way of increasing the blocksize without a hard-fork.  

The advantage of this approach is that the community can slowly choose to adopt the change, instead of attempting to coordinate everyone updating at the same time.

The downside of this approach is it actually will consume a little more space than if the limit was simply increased.  This is why Bitcoin Cash removed SegWit. Increasing the blocksize limit, if possible, is a better solution.

## Conclusion

Bitcoin Cash is an incremental improvement to Bitcoin.  The group behind it thought that the Bitcoin community was simply moving too slowly and pushed a change to address Bitcoin's largest concern, scaling.

The response to Bitcoin Cash has been mixed.  The problem of scaling can still be addressed by Bitcoin, and much of the community would rather have focused more on those discussions than see a hard-fork like Bitcoin Cash create confusion in the marketplace.
