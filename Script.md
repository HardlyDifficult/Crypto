What's Bitcoin Cash?

You may have heard of Bitcoin Cash, but how is it different from Bitcoin?

Let's start by looking at the problems with Bitcoin that Bitcoin Cash wanted to address.

Bitcoin is currently running at max capacity. It simply cannot process any more transactions than it already is.  

Bitcoin supports about 4 transactions per second.  Compare this to Visa's network, which can handle over fifty thousand transactions per second. 

Transaction fees on Bitcoin are also rising due to this limit.  When Bitcoin Cash was created in July 2017, Bitcoin's fees were around five dollars, and rising.  As of December 2017, we see fees of thirty dollars or more, while Bitcoin Cash's fees are only 20 cents.

The concern is that if this limit is not addressed, there is no future for Bitcoin as a transaction medium.  It simply cannot compete with Visa or Paypal.

Can Bitcoin be upgraded? Or is Version 1 the only Bitcoin we will ever know?

Bitcoin can be upgraded, and has been in the past.  Upgrades roll out when the majority of the community agrees to them. 

However, changes are slow coming, as there are no official leaders and no formal process for reaching consensus.  Anyone can make a proposal for the community to consider; in theory, the strongest proposals gain enough support that they may be rolled out. 

There is a group known as Bitcoin Core.  This group has earned the reputation of being leaders for Bitcoin without actually having any power.  They are not the owners of Bitcoin and cannot force a change to be accepted.

For a change to be accepted, consumers, node operators, and miners all need to agree to the change.

There are a lot of different ways that problems like transaction throughput could be addressed. Bitcoin has been debating this topic for years, and is making very little progress in terms of actually growing the network.

In fact, Bitcoin Cash's approach to addressing this problem, which we will review in a moment, was a proposal reviewed by Bitcoin Core as early as 2015.

Then how was Bitcoin Cash created?

Bitcoin Cash created a hard-fork in July of 2017, which included a small change to Bitcoin's technology. This was anticipated to significantly increase how many transactions the network could handle.

A 'Hard-Fork' means that Bitcoin was copy-pasted, and then modified for Bitcoin Cash.  

This copy-paste means that Bitcoin Cash inherits Bitcoin's security and stability, allowing them to make a small, targeted, low-risk change.

The copy-paste also means anyone with Bitcoin before the fork has both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash after the fork.

Wait, did everyone just double their money?!  In a way, yes.  If you had 1 Bitcoin before the fork, after the fork you have 1 Bitcoin plus 1 Bitcoin Cash. Once the fork has happened, they are independent, so you can spend your Bitcoin Cash without losing any Bitcoin.

Normally when a hard-fork occurs, one of the two forks is the clear winner. The other becomes worthless, and is eventually discarded.  This means that the total amount of money available after a fork will end up equal to the amount available before.

However, both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have stood strong.  Neither have proven themselves to be the clear winner, so both have real value.

So what, exactly, did Bitcoin Cash change?

Bitcoin Cash technically only made one small change from Bitcoin at the time.

They increased the maximum size of a block.

A block is a set of transactions which have been verified by miners and added to the blockchain.  

Increasing the maximum size of this block allows the network to process more transactions. 

Bitcoin Cash increased the blocksize from 1 megabyte to 8 megabytes.  This means Bitcoin Cash can handle up to 8 times as many transactions as Bitcoin.  

Due to the increased throughput, Bitcoin Cash also offers significantly lower fees - at least until they reach capacity, too.

Couldn't you just mine more blocks?

Most blockchains, Bitcoin included, have a target cadence for block production.  This means that if more miners start creating blocks, instead of supporting more transactions, the work gets harder so that the same number of blocks are produced.  Another viable approach for supporting more transactions would be to decrease the target time between blocks. This is the approach Litecoin took.

So why wouldn't Bitcoin want to increase the limit?  And wait - why is there a limit at all?

Originally, Bitcoin had no limit.  The limit of 1 megabyte per block was added in 2010.  This limit was introduced to prevent a possible attack on Bitcoin.

Huge blocks could be added to increase the cost of running a node or a miner.  As a larger and larger hardware investment is required, less hobbyists participate, and the network starts to be controlled by a limited number of large companies.  

What has Bitcoin done to increase transaction volume?

Shortly after the launch of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin activated Segwit.  

Segwit, or "segregated witness," is a way of increasing the blocksize by up to 4 times without requiring a hard-fork. 

The advantage of this approach is that the community can choose to slowly adopt the change rather than attempt to coordinate everyone updating at the same time.

The downside of this approach is that it will consume a little more space than if the limit was simply increased.  This is why Bitcoin Cash will not adopt Segwit. Increasing the blocksize limit, if possible, is a better solution.

Bitcoin has been slowly adopting Segwit, but after 4 months it's still only used for 10% of transactions. Because of the slow adoption, Bitcoin has not seen much increase in the number of transactions supported, and therefore it continues to be slower and more expensive to use than Bitcoin Cash.  Once Segwit is fully adopted, Bitcoin Cash will still be able to support more than twice as many transactions.

In Conclusion...

Bitcoin Cash is an incremental improvement to Bitcoin.  The group behind it thought that the Bitcoin community was simply moving too slowly and pushed a change to address Bitcoin's largest concern - scaling.

The response to Bitcoin Cash has been mixed.  The problem of scaling can still be addressed by Bitcoin, and much of the community would rather focus more on those discussions than see a hard-fork like Bitcoin Cash create confusion in the marketplace.

One final point: there are other coins in the market which are aiming to address problems like scaling in new and innovative ways.  If scaling is your primary concern, other coins have solutions which promise to do thousands of times better than either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.
