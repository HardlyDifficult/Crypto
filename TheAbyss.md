# The Abyss

## Summary

The Abyss is an upcoming ICO which aims to become the 'in-app purchase' payment provider for browser games and MMOs.

## Tech

 - [Whitepaper](https://www.theabyss.com/static/docs/theabyss-whitepaper-en.pdf?20171208T130812)
 - Ethereum [ERC-20 tokens](about/ERC-20.md)
 - 70% rev share with game developers
   - % is after payment processor fees and taxes
 - Multilevel referral program

## Use Case

The focus of this project is on the referral program.  

From the whitepaper: a Whale spends $200,000 on Game B, here's where that money goes:

 - Game A gets $4,000 for referring Ron
 - Ron gets $4,000 for referring Hermione
 - Hermione gets $8,000 for referring the Whale
 - Game B is promised 70% rev share, which is $140,000
 - That leaves $44,000 for The Abyss.

\* Each of these values would be reduced evenly to cover payment processing and taxes.

## Pros 

 - 70% rev share is industry standard, so benefits from the referral program are a net positive for game developers.
 - A strong referral program can help to drive adoption of the platform.

## Cons

 - Very little mention of the tech or why blockchain was right for this project.
 - The timeline is long, with the first game expected to launch Q4 2018.

## Is The Abyss a Scam?

I don't think so, but there seems to be more focus on the multilevel referrals and suggesting everyone involved is going to get rich than details about the tech.  

It reads like a pyramid-scheme.

## Is This Project a Good Idea?

No, I don't think so.  

Using Ethereum tokens just complicates things for players.  I believe the dream is the overhead to take tokens out will encourage players to just spend those tokens on another game.

If Steam wanted to launch the same referral program they could.  Why use blockchain for this?
