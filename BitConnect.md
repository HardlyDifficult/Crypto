# BitConnect

TODO why is this a coin?

## How It Works

 1) Give BitConnect Money
 2) ?
 3) Profit!

In more detail:

 - Users deposit Bitcoin and then 'loan' it to BitConnect.  
 - BitConnect's secret trading bot uses these funds to buy and sell crypto currencies on various exchanges. 
 - Profits are then shared with people who loaned money to BitConnect, as a percent gain (which varies day-to-day).

## Is BitConnect a Scam?

Maybe.  A successful trading bot is certainly possible (I hope to build one someday ;) and it makes sense that if they did build one this good they would do everything possible to keep how it works secret (which would have to include hiding its wallet address so people could not reverse engineer decisions).  

However a pyramid-scheme would also fund this business model, and that just seems more plausible to me.  

Either way, people are really profiting from this ATM.  The key difference is that if this is a pyramid, as soon as more people are withdrawing than depositing the company is simply going to shut their doors and disappear with your money.

Red flags:

 - Worst case seems to be 0% return for a day, how could a trading bot ***never*** lose?
 -
