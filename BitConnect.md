## How It Works

In more detail, their primary service is 'Bitcoin Lending':

 - Users deposit Bitcoin and then 'loan' it to BitConnect.  
 - BitConnect's secret trading bot uses these funds to buy and sell crypto currencies on various exchanges. 
 - Profits are then shared as a percent gain (which varies day-to-day) with people who loaned money to BitConnect.

## Is BitConnect a Scam?

Seems like it.  A successful trading bot is certainly possible (I hope to build one someday ;), and it makes sense that if they did build one this good, they would do everything possible to keep how it works secret (which would have to include hiding its wallet address so people could not reverse engineer decisions).  

However, a pyramid scheme would also fund this business model, and that just seems more plausible to me.  

Either way, people are really profiting from this at the moment.  The key difference is that if this is a pyramid, as soon as more people are withdrawing than depositing, the company is simply going to shut their doors and disappear with your money.

Red flags:

 - Worst case seems to be 0% return for a day. How could a trading bot ***never*** lose?
 - 


# Questions

 - What is the benefit of having a BCC coin?  It seems their primary service, lending, could be offered without that step.
