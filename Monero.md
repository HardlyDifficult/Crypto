# Monero

## Summary

Monero is a trusted [public ledger](about/PublicLedger.md) hosted by [nodes](about/Nodes.md) and secured by [miners](about/Miners.md) using a [Proof of Work](about/ProofOfWork.md) algorithm.  Transactions and balances are private by default.

## Tech

 - Whitepaper
   - [Cryptonote](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf) meets [Ring Signatures](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf)
 - Private Transactions
   - Using ring signatures
   - Your balance and transactions are secured when paying a transaction.  This method requires no trust.
 - .5 - 2000 TPS 
    - Adaptive block sizes(TODO confirm)
    - Difficulty: target
      - Recalcs every block
 - Minting: TODO
 - Transactions
   - Confirmation time: TODO
   - dictated by an algorithm? TODO
 - Launched May 2014

## Pro

 - Strongest Privacy Option available
   - First to launch ring signatures successfully.

## Con

 - Strongest Privacy Option available
   - Public Perception: Dark web / association with crime
   - Government risks: Additional risk of censorship due to the need for surveillance
